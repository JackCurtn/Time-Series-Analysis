# Time-Series-Analysis
Project as part of a Time Series module for Financial Mathematics at University of Limerick.

The purpose of this project was to build a time series model in R to predict the average income per person in Ireland from 1950 to 2019. I did this by removing the last 10% of the data and subsequently transforming the remaining 90% so that I could build a predictive model. I found that an ARIMA(2,2,1) model fit the data almost perfectly.
